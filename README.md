Hangman
hangman is a small terminal based game I made to get the hang of pulling information from a json file on a web page, this one uses a webpage with a word list and then picks a random word from this list and gets the user to guess the word. Win or lose the player will find out the word that was chosen but there are different responses depending on what they do.
